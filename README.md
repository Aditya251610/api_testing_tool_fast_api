# API Testing Tool (FastAPI + Next.js)

A full-stack API testing and monitoring tool built with FastAPI (backend) and Next.js (frontend). The tool helps developers easily test, monitor, and visualize API endpoints with a modern web interface.

## Features

- **API Request Builder**: Compose and send HTTP requests with support for all common methods.
- **Authentication Support**: Easily add headers, tokens, or other authentication schemes.
- **Response Visualization**: View formatted responses, headers, status codes, and response times.
- **History & Logs**: Keep track of previous requests and API logs for auditing.
- **User Management**: Sign up, log in, and manage API testing workspaces.
- **Monitoring**: (Planned) Set up automated monitors for endpoint health checks.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS, Tailwind, or your chosen framework
- **Database**: (Add your DB here if applicable)
- **Other**: (Add Redis, Celery, or others if used)
